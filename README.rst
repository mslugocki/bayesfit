Hello BayesFitters!

Excited to announce that I will be revamping Bayesfit in the coming weeks / months ahead ðŸ¥³  Also, to celebrate this event, I purchased the domain **bayesfit.org** to provide a stable resource for managing documentation, as well as providing more in-depth updates for those folks who are interested.

Please stay tuned, and thank you for using BayesFit. Your feedback is always appreciated.
 
Kind Regards,
